## Introduction

Creating a Python package is an essential skill for any Python developer. It allows you to organize your code, make it reusable, and share it with others. In this post, we'll go through the process of setting up a Python package step by step.

## Setting Up the Package Structure

1. Create a new directory for your package:
   ```bash
   mkdir my_package
   cd my_package
   ```

2. Create the following file structure:
   ```
   my_package/
   ├── my_package/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   └── main.py
   ├── tests/
   │   └── test_main.py
   ├── README.md
   ├── LICENSE
   └── setup.py
   ```

## Writing setup.py

The `setup.py` file is crucial for packaging your project. Here's a basic example:
```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name="my_package",
    version="0.1.0",
    packages=find_packages(exclude=["tests"]),
    install_requires=[
        "dependency1",
        "dependency2",
    ],
    author="Your Name",
    author_email="your.email@example.com",
    description="A short description of your package",
    long_description=open("README.md").read(),
    long_description_content_type="text/markdown",
    url="https://github.com/yourusername/my_package",
    classifiers=[
        "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
        "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
        "Operating System :: OS Independent",
    ],
    python_requires=">=3.7",
)
```


## Managing Dependencies

List your package dependencies in the `install_requires` parameter of `setup()`. For development dependencies, you can create a `requirements.txt` file:
In `requirements.txt`, you can write like below.

```
# Image processing and visualization
opencv-python # or opencv-python-headless
matplotlib

# LangChain and related libraries
langchain
langchain-core
langchain_openai
langchain_anthropic
redis
python-dotenv

# Database
mysql-connector-python

# Additional requirements
numpy
# torch # (Need to check the Jetpack version if on Jetson)
openai
anyio
pydantic
scipy
```

## Version Control with Git

1. Initialize a Git repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. Create a `.gitignore` file:
   ```
   __pycache__/
   *.pyc
   *.egg-info/
   dist/
   build/
   .pytest_cache/
   ```

3. Make your first commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

## Building and Publishing

1. Install build tools:
   ```bash
   pip install build twine
   ```

2. Build your package:
   ```bash
   python -m build
   ```

3. Upload to PyPI (ensure you have an account):
   ```bash
   twine upload dist/*
   ```

## Installing Your Package

Once published, you can install your package using pip:

```bash
pip install my_package
```


For development or to install from GitHub:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/yourusername/my_package.git
```

## Updating Your Package

1. Update your code and increment the version number in `setup.py`.
2. Rebuild and republish:
   ```bash
   python -m build
   twine upload dist/*
   ```

To update an installed package:

```bash
pip install --upgrade my_package
```

Or for a GitHub-installed package:
```bash
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/yourusername/my_package.git
```

## Automating Package Publishing with GitHub Actions

To automate the process of publishing your package to PyPI whenever you push a new release, you can use GitHub Actions. Here's how to set it up:

1. Create a `.github/workflows/publish.yml` file in your repository:

```yaml:.github/workflows/publish.yml
name: Publish Python Package

on:
  release:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.x'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install build twine
    - name: Build and publish
      env:
        TWINE_USERNAME: __token__
        TWINE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}
      run: |
        python -m build
        twine upload dist/*
```

This workflow will trigger whenever you create a new release on GitHub. It sets up Python, installs the necessary dependencies, builds your package, and uploads it to PyPI using the credentials stored in GitHub Secrets.

2. Store your PyPI API token as a secret in your GitHub repository:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click on "Settings" > "Secrets" > "New repository secret"
   - Name the secret `PYPI_API_TOKEN` and paste your PyPI API token as the value

## Managing PyPI Credentials with .pypirc

For local development and manual uploads, you can use a `.pypirc` file to store your PyPI credentials securely. Here's how to set it up:

1. Create a `.pypirc` file in your home directory:

```ini:.pypirc
[distutils]
index-servers =
    pypi
    testpypi

[pypi]
username = __token__
password = your_pypi_api_token

[testpypi]
repository = https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
username = __token__
password = your_testpypi_api_token
```

Replace `your_pypi_api_token` and `your_testpypi_api_token` with your actual API tokens for PyPI and TestPyPI respectively.

2. Set appropriate permissions for the `.pypirc` file:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.pypirc
```

This ensures that only you can read or write to the file.

With this setup, you can easily publish your package using `twine` without having to enter your credentials each time. For example:

```bash
twine upload dist/*
```

Remember to never commit the `.pypirc` file to your version control system, as it contains sensitive information.
And finally you can see the installed package like below image.
