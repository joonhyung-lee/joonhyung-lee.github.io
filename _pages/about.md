Hello everyone! 
I am an AI research engineer at [ATLO](https://atlo.ai/), where I lead the development of [ATTO](https://atlo.site/) and [DITTO](https://apps.apple.com/kr/app/%EB%94%94%ED%86%A0-ditto-%EB%84%88%EC%99%80-%ED%95%A8%EA%BB%98%ED%95%98%EB%A9%B0-%EC%88%9C%EA%B0%84%EC%9D%84-%EA%B8%B0%EB%A1%9D%ED%95%98%EB%8A%94-%EC%B9%9C%EA%B5%AC/id6743839550), our AI digital companion robot, as Head of Software.

<!-- My research is at the intersection of robotics and machine learning. -->
My research focuses on developing robots with human-like intelligence capabilities for real-world applications, making them intuitive and accessible for everyday users. I'm particularly interested in enhancing robots' physics-reliable behaviors and commonsense reasoning, while pursuing omni-modality capabilities that allow them to understand across text, vision, audio, and other sensory inputs. 
My goal is to create AI systems that can handle complex daily tasks autonomously through reinforcement learning and generative models, ultimately bridging the gap between academic AI research and practical robotic solutions.

I completed my M.S. in the [A.I. department at Korea University](https://info.korea.edu/en_info/grad/ai_intro.do), where I was advised by [Sungjoon Choi](https://sites.google.com/view/sungjoon-choi). 
Previously, I completed my B.S. at Korea University. My previous internship includes working on reinforcement learning for navigation robots in KAIST [MDI Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/donghwanleehome/home?authuser=0) and participating in robotics and computer vision projects including a 3 DOF robot arm and color-based tracking algorithm.

##### **Research Topic:** 
- Robotics Control, Large Language Models, Physics-based Simulation
