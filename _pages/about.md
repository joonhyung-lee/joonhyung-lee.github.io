Hello everyone!

I'm an AI Engineer at [Rebellions](https://rebellions.ai/), working on accelerating AI systems for <u>physical robotics</u> on NPU devices.
I founded a start-up and created a multimodal AI agent with an emotion-aware dialogue chatbot. Our product has been deployed on hardware robots, iOS and web platforms. [DITTO](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ditto-the-friend-who-gets-you/id6743839550)

My research focuses on (1) improving <u>physical reliability</u> through simulation-to-real transfer and (2) enhancing <u>contextual understanding</u> with Foundation models for complex manipulation tasks.

I completed my M.S. in [Artificial Intelligence](https://en_ai.korea.edu/en_ai/index.do) at Korea University under the supervision of [Sungjoon Choi](https://sites.google.com/view/sungjoon-choi). I also worked on reinforcement learning for robot navigation at KAIST [MDI Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/donghwanleehome/home).

##### **Research Topic:**

- Physics-based Robot Control and Simulation
- Robot Foundation Models (e.g., VLA) & Contact-based RL
- Human-Robot Interaction and Preference Learning
